# Influmatch Deployment Notes

## üìù **Important Deployment Note**

**Current Status**: Simple deployment for platform validation and testing

**Next Phase**: After platform validation is complete, we need to plan and execute a **proper production deployment** with:

### **Production Deployment Requirements (Post-Validation)**

1. **Database Migration**
   - Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
   - Set up proper database backups and monitoring
   - Implement database connection pooling

2. **Infrastructure Scaling**
   - Set up proper production hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
   - Implement load balancing and auto-scaling
   - Set up CDN for static assets

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement proper SSL certificates
   - Set up security headers and CORS policies
   - Configure rate limiting and DDoS protection
   - Set up proper secret management

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Implement application monitoring (Sentry, DataDog)
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Configure logging and alerting
   - Set up analytics tracking

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up automated testing and deployment
   - Implement staging and production environments
   - Set up automated backups and rollback procedures

6. **Domain & SSL**
   - Purchase and configure custom domain
   - Set up proper SSL certificates
   - Configure DNS and subdomains

### **Current Simple Deployment Purpose**
- **Goal**: Validate platform functionality and user experience
- **Scope**: Basic hosting for testing and feedback collection
- **Timeline**: Quick deployment for immediate validation
- **Next Step**: Plan comprehensive production deployment after validation

---

**Note**: This simple deployment is for validation purposes only. A proper production deployment will be planned and executed once the platform is validated and ready for scale.
